# Mini_Project
AIM : To Design and Develop Deep learning algorithms which can make diagnosis based on medical data and categorize vast variety of data records which will be used to assist doctors and managing large medical data records in hospitals in real time.

OBJECTIVES:
1.To reduce misdiagnosis and medical errors significantly saving time and unnecessary need for further diagnosis.
2.Cross Verification of Diagnosis by doctors in rural areas become easy and faster improving their experience.
3.For managing large amount of medical data in real time.
